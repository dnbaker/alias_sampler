# alias_sampler ðŸŽ­ [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dnbaker/alias_sampler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dnbaker/alias_sampler)

Alias sampling, for sampling from discrete probability distributions in constant time.

libstdc++ uses binary search in a cumulative probability array, which both takes logarithmic time and pollutes the cache. This doesn't.

AliasSampler uses [fastmod](https://lemire.me/blog/2019/02/08/faster-remainders-when-the-divisor-is-a-constant-beating-compilers-and-libdivide/), while MaskedAliasSampler pads to a power of two with items at probability 0 and uses a bitmask.

These samplers provide single samples (`sampler.sample()` or `sampler()`), a batch of samples (`sampler.sample(1000)`/`sampler(1000)`),
or fills a range spanned by iterators with samples (`sampler.sample(vec.begin(), vec.end(), sampling_seed)`).

Beyond a certain each successive sample of one item requires a cache miss; the bulk method samples a set of integers
in sequence and sorts them in order to do one pass through the alias table in order, which allows for both prefetching and minimizing cache misses.

Uses std::sort unless pdqsort has been included, in which case it selects it.
Similarly, uses blaze for vector multiplications if available, but not otherwise.
